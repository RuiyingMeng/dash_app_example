# dash_app_example

What this project can do:
 - read data file nama_10_gdp.tsv to DataFrame
 - created a dashboard using Python library Dash to visualize the data, including one scatter chart and one line chart
 - Used Dash Callbacks (dash.dependencies.Input, Output, State) to make the visualization interactive with users
 - In line chart, changed options of unit (unit of measures) according to users' selection of na_item (national indicator item) and geo (country), as there is no data available to show, given a specific combination of na_item, geo and unit.
